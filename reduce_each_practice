#  1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.
#     Use a .each then a .reduce

#  2. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "volleyballbasketballbadminton".
#     Use a .each then a .reduce

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and compute the sum of the prices (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes 105.
#     Use a .each then a .reduce

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and compute the the minumum number.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3, 9] becomes 3.
#     Use a .each then a .reduce

#  5. Start with an array of strings and compute the total length of all the strings.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes 29.
#     Use a .each then a .reduce
