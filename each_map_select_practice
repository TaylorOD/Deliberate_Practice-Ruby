# 1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
# #     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9]. Use .map

# #  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
# #     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"]. Use .map

# #  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of string values from each hash's :name key.
# #     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"]. Use .map

# 4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number plus 7.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [8, 9, 10]. Use .map

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's length.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes [5, 7]. Use .each

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [27, 16]. Use .each

# 7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number divided by 2.
# #     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]. Use .each

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"]. Use .select

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
#     Use .select

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7]. Use .select
