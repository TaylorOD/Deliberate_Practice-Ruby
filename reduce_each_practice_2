 1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
    For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.
    Use .each and .reduce

2. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string.
    For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "volleyballbasketballbadminton".
    Use .each and .reduce

 3. Start with an array of hashes and compute the sum of the prices (from the :price key).
    For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes 105.
    Use .each and .reduce

4. Start with an array of numbers and compute the the minumum number.
    For example, [5, 10, 8, 3, 9] becomes 3.
    Use .each and .reduce

 5. Start with an array of strings and compute the total length of all the strings.
    For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes 29.
    Use .each and .reduce

 6. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the lowest price (from the :price key).
    For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "pencil", price: 1}.
    Use a .each then a .reduce

 7. Start with an array of numbers and compute product of all the numbers.
    For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 1200.
    Use a .each then a .reduce

 8. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string, separated by dashes.
    For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "-volleyball-basketball-badminton-".
    Use a .each then a .reduce

 9. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the shortest name (from the :name key).
    For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "book", price: 4}.
    Use a .each then a .reduce

10. Start with an array of numbers and compute the maximum number.
    For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 10.
    Use a .each then a .reduce
