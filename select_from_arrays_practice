#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
#     For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3]. 
#     Use a while loop.

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
#     For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].
#     Use a while loop.

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].
#     Use a while loop.

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].
#     Use the .each method.

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
#     For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].
#     Use the .each method.

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
#     Use the .each method.

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
#     For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].
#     Use the .select method.

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
#     For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].
#     Use the .select method.

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].
#     Use the .select method.

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
#     Use the .select method.
