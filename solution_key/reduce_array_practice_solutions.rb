#  1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26. Use while loop.

#  2. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "volleyballbasketballbadminton". Use while loop.

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and compute the sum of the prices (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes 105. Use .each method.

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and compute the the minumum number.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3, 9] becomes 3. Use . each method.

#  5. Start with an array of strings and compute the total length of all the strings.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes 29. Use .each method.

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the lowest price (from the :price key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "pencil", price: 1}.
#     Use .reduce method.

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and compute product of all the numbers.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 1200. Use .reduce method.

#  8. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string, separated by dashes.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "-volleyball-basketball-badminton-".
#     Use .reduce method.

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the shortest name (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "book", price: 4}.
#     Use .reduce method.



# 10. Start with an array of numbers and compute the maximum number.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 10. Use .reduce method.
