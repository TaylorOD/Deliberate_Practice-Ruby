#  8. Start with an array of strings and combine them all into a single string, separated by dashes.
#     For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes "-volleyball-basketball-badminton-".
#     Use .reduce method.

#  9. Start with an array of hashes and find the hash with the shortest name (from the :name key).
#     For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes {name: "book", price: 4}.
#     Use .reduce method.



# 10. Start with an array of numbers and compute the maximum number.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 10. Use .reduce method.
