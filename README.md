# Deliberate Practice - Ruby

Practice coding in Ruby using these problems focused around common Ruby coding principles. A solutions key for each set of practice problems is located at the bottom of the list of problems. Try to write your code without referencing the solutions key first and then check it if needed. If you use the key, start the problem over. 

Feel free to suggest additional practice problems and to fork these problems for your own practice.
