#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's length.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes [5, 7].

# 3.  Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key times 2.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number plus 7.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [8, 9, 10].

# 5. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [27, 16].
